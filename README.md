MentalMatters was designed to be an active tool for youth (specifically students), as mental health issues have become more common around the world. Life can be stressful and overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be. With a strong support system, the right resources, and time, all mental health challenges can be overcome. We believe that MentalMatters is one of these resources: capable, lightweight, and accurate. 

MentalMatters is a web-based project due to accessibility: whether it be through smartphones, tablets, laptops, or desktop computers, MentalMatters works seamlessly for all user experiences.

We utilize the popular ChatGPT generative AI to automatically analyze the user’s day and emotions. Through the daily reflection, users can share their personal struggles, accomplishments, goals, social interactions, eating habits, and more. The AI will check for symptoms of mental health disorders, and recommend ways to help.

 To make sure everything remains secure, a cloud API through Firebase Cloud Functions is utilized as a bridge between the user and ChatGPT. Firebase acts as a shield from malicious programs or peoples, keeping all the confidential information private. 

The browser’s local capabilities (localStorage and Cookies) are leveraged to display and save information on the user’s device. This ensures that no information can be stolen without physical access to the user’s device. Furthermore, it is also quicker and less cost-intensive to not store information on a bulky server.

The MentalMatters website was made using HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap Framework. The backend processing utilized Javascript, Firebase (for security purposes), and ChatGPT. The integrated development environment (IDE) used was Visual Studio Code. MentalMatters is currently supported on Github.
